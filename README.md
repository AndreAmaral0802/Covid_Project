# Covid_Project

This is a Covid19 project that I have been working on to have a better understanding of the virus and how it spreads across the world. For this, I used a dataset from  
https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. I used SQL server to do the queries and Power BI to visualise my findings.
